        <p>
          I love building software that makes a difference. After a decade in human services, I retrained as a web developer to keep making tools that help solve meaningful problems and have a great user experience. I’m excited to learn and experiment with new technologies to create engaging, intuitive, and technically sound products.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          At <a href="https://torontoverse.com">Torontoverse<span class="link"> (https://torontoverse.com)</span></a> I’ve solidified and expanded my tech stack, building map-based visualizations that tell stories big and small, helping readers to explore Toronto in a new way. I’ve led strategic
          analysis of complex problems, facilitated projects through evolving challenges, and produced tangible outcomes on strict deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally from Aotearoa (New Zealand), I’m now living in Hamilton, Ontario after five years in Toronto. I’ve
          been lucky to discover and join welcoming communities on my journey, and getting to know people along the way has led to
          so many of the things I love today, like great coffee, tabletop gaming, and reading anything from comics to critical
          theory.
